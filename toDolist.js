// TO DO LIST

// Add cardNumVal to each card to eleminate getFaceCardValue function

// Refractor checkTotalHandValue to add cardNumVal (total + element.cardNumVal)

// Add the following to the board State => handTotal for both dealer and player / numberOfAces for both /

// Create hold button and function that will fire

// Figure out how to create a new deck on the fly one the deck is less then 4

// Create styled components that takes the place of dealers-card-container, players-card-container and cards in the board component. I may be able to nest the card style inside the dealer and player container.
