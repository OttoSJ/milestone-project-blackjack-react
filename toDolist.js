// TO DO LIST

// Add pointer hand to all buttons (style= {{cusor: "pointer"}}. Better to make this a class in css and just add the class to any clickable icons. I can just make a class called .clickable {cusor: "pointer"})

// Add cardNumVal to each card to eleminate getFaceCardValue function

// Refractor checkTotalHandValue to add cardNumVal (total + element.cardNumVal)

// Add the following to the board State => handTotal for both dealer and player / numberOfAces for both /

// Create hold button and function that will fire

// Figure out how to create a new deck on the fly one the deck is less then 4

// Render back of deck onto the dealers container. In the future I can make it an option to show the back of a blue or red deck.

// FUTURE FEATURES AND OPTIONS *************************************

// Give user the option to show red or blue deck for the dealer

// Give user the choice of how many decks they play with (4, 6, 8).
